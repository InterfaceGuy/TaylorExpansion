# TaylorExpansion
![](TaylorExpansion.gif)
a mathematical function that approximates any analytic function (in this case a sine curve) to the n-th order through a sum of polynomials
within a given range the approximation can become infinitely precise
while outside that range it will always remain infinitely poor
as such it lends itself beautifully as a metaphor for negative externalities through narrow field of consideration
